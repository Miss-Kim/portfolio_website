        <h2>My Story</h2>
     <article> <p>Hello, I am Kim. I am a passionate UX & UI Designer and a cat enthusiast - hoping to further my career in the design space.</p>
        <p>My journey into UX started when I wanted a career change in early 2021. My previous work experience in retail and healthcare lead me to find the common thread in UX as I want to understand people so that I can improve their lives in some way. I am currently learning Front-end Development for Designers - so that I will be able to create effective design systems and handoff assets the correct way and collaborate better with the devs.</p> 
        
        <p>I was born in Myanmar but immigrated to Oslo with my family in 2005. Since moving to Oslo, I have published 2 books and have been featured in another 2 books, founded a non-profit Humanitarian Aid Organization in 2012 - to help and provide orphanages in Myanmar and successfully completed 6 projects for 4860 children. Today I am a co-founder of 4Gladiators indie gaming studio where I help create content for the games to bug testing. My roles shaped my process-oriented approach to problem-solving along with a genuine curiosity to learn.</p>
        <p>I describe myself as a wanderlust. My passion for travel and culture has led me to make connections and friendships in 22 countries and learn languages as I speak 3, and I am learning Japanese at the moment.</p>
        
        <p>Thanks for taking this time to get to know me. If you're so inclined, I'd like to get to know you too! Just fill out the form at the bottom.
